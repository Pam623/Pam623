- 💬 Ask me about social media, live-streaming & SSW Marketing + TV
- 📺 I’ve worked in e-commerce live-streaming & even hosted the Huangshan Maofeng Tea Harvest Ceremony
- ✍️ I majored in Chinese Language & Literature, so I’m a words + storytelling nerd
- 🎬 Love filming travel vlogs (editing? never met her) 🤣
- 🎨 Big fan of handicrafts
- 🏸 Recently I’ve been trying all the things with SSWers – badminton, board games, frisbee & skateboarding
- 🌍 Keen to connect and explore new possibilities ✨
